## About Me
For the last 12 years I've been working in travel. But since the pandemic started i thought more and more about changing my filed of activity. I decided to try web-development and the more i study the more i am interested in. I have good educational skills which will help me to graduate successfully. I also have excellent softskills (beacuse of my previous job specific) which is important both for interviews and for future communication at work.
## Skills
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript (basics)
* Git/GitHub
## Code Example
```
function fakeBin(x) {
let result = '';
  for (let char of x) {
    if (char < 5) {
     char = 0;
    } else {
     char = 1;
    }
    result = `${result}${char}`;
  }
  return result;
};
```
